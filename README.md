# Lua/LÃ¶ve2D Lighting and Shadow Algorithm ðŸ’¡

The algorithm to calculate the lit area is based on [this video](https://youtu.be/fc3nnG2CG8U?list=LL) by the amazing **One Lone Coder**. I am still working on cleaning up the code and doing a write up on the whole project...

The result looks something like this:
